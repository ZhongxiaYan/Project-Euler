# Project Euler Solutions

Project Euler (https://projecteuler.net/archives) is a website with interesting math puzzles that one can solve programmatically.

To see the formulation of problem <x>, go to https://projecteuler.net/problem=<x>.

## 1 - 53

These are solutions that I created in high school when I had near 0 programming experience (and added to Git later). Please don't judge the crappy code quality :).

## 53 - 79 (except 66)

These are solutions that I created after taking the intro CS course. Has Python, C, and C++ solutions.

## 66 and 79 - 143

Unfortunately I lost these from the hard disk when I wiped my computer at some point. These are solutions that I created after taking the algorithm's course. Has dynamic programming solutions to some puzzles that need them. I also used C when I need the raw computation.

## 144 - 150 (currently)
Has dynamic programming solutions to some puzzles that need them. Otherwise uses patterns that I find within the problem to simplify calculation. I also used C when I need the raw computation.
