# Project Euler Solutions

Project Euler (https://projecteuler.net/archives) is a website with interesting math puzzles that one can solve programmatically.

## 1 - 53

These are solutions that I created in high school when I had near 0 programming experience (and added to Git later). Please don't judge the crappy code quality :).

## 53 - 79

These are solutions that I created after taking the intro CS course. Has Python, C, and C++ solutions.

## 79 - (currently 143)

Unfortunately I lost these from the hard disk when I wiped my computer at some point. These are solutions that I created after taking the algorithm's course. Has dynamic programming solutions to some puzzles that need them. I also used C when I need the raw computation.
